#File Handling
'''
The key function for working with files in Python is the open() function.

The open() function takes two parameters; filename, and mode.

There are four different methods (modes) for opening a file:

"r" - Read - Default value. Opens a file for reading, error if the file does not exist

"a" - Append - Opens a file for appending, creates the file if it does not exist

"w" - Write - Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist

"x" - Create - Creates the specified file, returns an error if the file exists

In addition you can specify if the file should be handled as binary or text mode

"t" - Text - Default value. Text mode

"b" - Binary - Binary mode (e.g. images)

'''
'''
To open a file for reading it is enough to specify the name of the file:

f = open("demofile.txt")
The code above is the same as:

f = open("demofile.txt", "rt")
Because "r" for read, and "t" for text are the default values, you do not need to specify them.'''
#to create the file we use x or create with openn and write 
with open("data.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("This is Day 9!")

#in this we read the file
f = open("data.txt")
print(f.read())
