#Python OOP
'''
OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.

Python is an object-oriented language, allowing you to structure your code using classes and objects for better organization and reusability.

Advantages of OOP:
Provides a clear structure to programs
Makes code easier to maintain, reuse, and debug
Helps keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
Allows you to build reusable applications with less code
Tip: The DRY principle means you should avoid writing the same code more than once. Move repeated code into functions or classes and reuse it.

What are Classes and Objects?
Classes and objects are the two core concepts in object-oriented programming.

A class defines what an object should look like, and an object is created based on that class. For example:

Class	Objects
Fruit	Apple, Banana, Mango
Car	Volvo, Audi, Toyota
When you create an object from a class, it inherits all the variables and functions defined inside that class.
